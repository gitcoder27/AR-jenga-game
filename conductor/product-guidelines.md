# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** **Studio / Professional.** The game environment features high-end studio lighting (HDR), neutral professional backdrops, and a mix of natural textures (wood) with futuristic robotic elements.
*   **Atmosphere:** Clean, high-fidelity, and focused. The design emphasizes clarity and precision, reflecting the mechanical nature of the robotic interaction.

## User Interface (UX/UI)
*   **Design Philosophy:** **Minimalist & Diegetic.** The User Interface should be as unobtrusive as possible. Where possible, embed information directly into the 3D world (e.g., stability indicators on the table surface) or use subtle, clean overlays that do not break immersion.
*   **Feedback:** Visual feedback should be high-tech but clean. For example, the robotic hand glows cyan when active, and the HUD uses monospace typography and LED-style status indicators.

## Voice & Tone
*   **Style:** **Direct & Instructional.** All text, including tutorials, error messages, and in-game prompts, should be clear, concise, and unambiguous.
*   **Goal:** To eliminate confusion regarding the novel control scheme. Instructions like "Pinch to grab" or "Show hand to calibrate" should be instant to read and understand, ensuring the player focuses on the physical skill of the game rather than deciphering text.
