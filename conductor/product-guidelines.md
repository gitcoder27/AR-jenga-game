# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** **Lo-Fi / Cozy.** The game environment should evoke a relaxed, warm atmosphere, similar to a comfortable study room. Use soft, warm lighting, wooden textures, and a calming color palette to create an inviting space that contrasts with the tension of the gameplay.
*   **Atmosphere:** Immersive and grounded. The visual design should minimize digital distractions, making the virtual Jenga tower feel like a physical object in a real room.

## User Interface (UX/UI)
*   **Design Philosophy:** **Minimalist & Diegetic.** The User Interface should be as unobtrusive as possible. Where possible, embed information directly into the 3D world (e.g., stability indicators on the table surface) or use subtle, clean overlays that do not break immersion.
*   **Feedback:** Visual feedback for interactions (like the "pinch" gesture) should be clear but stylized to fit the cozy aesthetic, avoiding jarring, high-contrast arcade effects.

## Voice & Tone
*   **Style:** **Direct & Instructional.** All text, including tutorials, error messages, and in-game prompts, should be clear, concise, and unambiguous.
*   **Goal:** To eliminate confusion regarding the novel control scheme. Instructions like "Pinch to grab" or "Show hand to calibrate" should be instant to read and understand, ensuring the player focuses on the physical skill of the game rather than deciphering text.
